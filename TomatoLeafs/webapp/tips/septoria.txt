Tomato leaf Septoria, also known as Septoria leaf spot, is a common fungal disease that affects tomato plants, causing yellowing of leaves and dark spots with a lighter center. Here are some steps to treat tomato leaf Septoria:

1. Remove infected leaves: As soon as you notice Septoria leaf spot, remove infected leaves from the tomato plant. This will help prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant.
2. Improve air circulation: Provide adequate spacing between tomato plants to allow for good air circulation. This will help reduce humidity and prevent the growth of the fungus.
3. Water at the base: Avoid overhead watering and instead water at the base of the tomato plant. Wet leaves can encourage the growth of the fungus.
4. Apply fungicides: Fungicides can help control the spread of tomato leaf Septoria. Choose a fungicide labeled for use on tomatoes, and follow the instructions carefully.
5. Consider preventive measures: To prevent tomato leaf Septoria in the future, choose disease-resistant tomato varieties, rotate your crops each year, and avoid planting tomatoes in areas where the disease has been present in the past.
